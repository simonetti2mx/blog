        <a href="https://javascript.info/class-inheritance">class inheritance in java script</a>

        Looking at how classes in javascript interact with each other. This is very similar to what java is, so its pretty familiar. 
        <br><br>
        <pre>class Animal {
            constructor(name) {
              this.speed = 0;
              this.name = name;
            }
            run(speed) {
              this.speed = speed;
              alert(`${this.name} runs with speed ${this.speed}.`);
            }
            stop() {
              this.speed = 0;
              alert(`${this.name} stands still.`);
            }
          }
          
          let animal = new Animal("My animal");</pre>

          Here's some example code as the how inheritance works. Animal is the prototype for the animal class. So we can make more specific types of animals.
