    Blog Entry Number One

      A pretty fun intro week. Setting up an actual front facing web server is
      actually really interesting, and surprisingly little bugs. I realize I
      need this page to actually link to separate blog entries, I assume pages
      hosted on this domain still, but I'm a bit unclear on how to do that
      still. (Nevermind I got it) <br><br>A lot of the code snippets for the html this
      week were pretty simple, and mostly refreshers. It was good starting
      point, especially with a lot of the anchor stuff. I assume this post can
      be pretty concise, as its a fairly low effort week still. This page is
      super ugly I am in pain looking at it.
