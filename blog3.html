        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">CSS targeting</a>
        This is more of a refresher for me, but probably the single most important part of CSS (for me). Its really important to understand targeting to fully capture the true potential of css.
        While css is just for style, and you can obviously work around not knowing how to use selectors well, it really cleans up your code and makes the HTML more readable without having to use 
        100 different class tags to target something. Being able to say "the first child", or "the last image", is a functionality of CSS that I really enjoy.


        Lets take the "nth of type", selector as an example. 
        
        <br><br>
        <pre>p:nth-of-type(2) {
            background: red;
          }</pre>
<pre>
          This piece of code enable you to target the SECOND paragraph that is within a paragraph tag, so <\p><\p>we are selecting here<\/p>not here<\/p></pre>

        this functionality is really what makes CSS so widely used, and is a power that needs to be handled.
